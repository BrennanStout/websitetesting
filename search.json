All share similar issues, but I selected Texas as the example to look at here. For the axes, their main problem is that the text is quite small especially for the percentages and in comparison to the labels of the energy types. An additional issue with the percentages is that while both sides run from 0-100%, the labels are not consistent between the left and the right and as they lack line markings on the sides the labels are difficult to interpret. For the chart itself, the issue is that the shapes are unclear and it is rather more difficult to distinguish different years. The decision to do this likely came from the animation of the different charts at the beginning of the article. However, this choice hampers the charts when they are used outside of the animation. The charts could also use a grid to help distinguish shapes and make the vertical axes cleaner.\nPopovich, Nadja. 2024. “How Does Your State Make Electricity?” New York Times, August 2. https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/02/climate/electricity-generation-us-states.html."

For the GFT itself, this was an attempt to predict outbreaks of flu-like illnesses through the analysis of terms being searched by individuals. While the ability to predict outbreaks with this trend model worked for a time, it began to become less consistent with the CDC data on when the outbreaks actually were. The article proposes a couple different reasons as to why these errors began to appear and why these errors show up in other big data projects. First among these reasons, is that of the perception of big data as the ultimate form of data analysis. That is, with enough data the needs of modeling, data validation, and other more traditional means of data analysis are not need. What this can result in, is a dataset that while massive and collected in seemingly a logical way does not have the hallmarks of an intentional dataset built to do analysis on. This brings us to the second reason, with a dataset built from inputs such as internet posts or other such fallible means to get a model that fits well is a challenge but possible. However, that possibility must be tempered by a full and complete understanding of the data and that different models while appearing to fit well could be concealing errors or tends to run counter to the perceived results. This, over fitting was another of the factor in the GFT issues, their 50 million search terms were fitting to only 1152 data points and while there was reasoning behind those terms that were precluded from the model some were highly correlated with the CDC’s data and likely should have been taken as a sign of overfitting. To compound this particular issue was that of the platform being used to gather this data, that being an ever changing ever evolving search engine. While such a problem is not necessarily unique to only large search engines as any data collection method may undergo updates or refinements over their lifetime, the extent to which large search engines may shift is difficult to ascertain and even more so model the impacts of. And finally, the third and final issue with the GFT and big data projects, that of reproducibility a cornerstone of science as we understand it. These big data projects with their oversized datasets and propensity towards proprietary collection methods can produce results which cannot be reproduced. This was the case with the GFT, as the researchers obscured the search terms being looked for, combined with the inability for Google to release the full dataset means this project was irreplicable and as a result with the deterioration of the predictive power of the model the GFT at this point only has real use as a warning of the pitfalls of big data. # Dr Edward Tufte The Future\nThe main take away from this talk I feel is that while the mission and objectives of data visualization are fairly clear, the achieving of them are far and away more difficult. A large part of this gap is that the in order to communicate data most effectively one needs to deeply understand not just the data but also how you as a researcher operate and understands yourself. According to Dr. Tufte, the problems arising from an incomplete understanding can take several forms. Perhaps the simplest presented was that of data error, inconsistent formats and incomplete datasets that go unrecognized through the analysis. On the part of the researcher, bias can arise from things like overfocusing on a particular subset or a desire to adjust the fit of the model slightly. These areas of bias can also be externally introduced, through the pressure of sponsors or even the understanding that the method being used is the “best practice”. All these can cause bias or error unless accounted for and accounted for well. Dr. Tufte’s stress this significantly, that humans are fallible, and analysis will follow especially when what is being researched are humans. However, if the one is able to reach the stage of communicating the results of the research to another person the difficulty now comes from choosing from among the myriad of methods to show, tell, or make clear which one to use and advancements in technology have only made this decision even harder. As is put forward in the presentation, data visualization has the purpose of assisting the reasoning of the viewer about what is being shown. For this reason, visualizations are always to a degree unique to the dataset and the person behind it. Even for the same data, a different person will understand it differently and wish to place the focus of the visualization on what they want to communicate from that understanding. There are however, if not better than more effective means of doing that communication, Dr. Tufte highlights elements such as contrasts, comparisons, and the use of space. There should be no extraneous elements or choices made for the sake of simplicity alone. This strikes at the central point of his talk, that excellence does not come from half measures. Communication of any form, operates at the highest level when the one doing the communicating has the knowledge of the subject and the understanding of precisely which elements of that knowledge must be comprehended by the other party. And while those elements are ambiguous and the subject unspecified, when it is used in the realm of science the understood goal should be that the truth is being sought in good faith and what is being communicated aligns as best as is able with that truth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nassignment2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrennan Stout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrennan Stout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSep 10, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
